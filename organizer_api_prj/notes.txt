storing files in the database would be to time consuming
storing files in heroku's static folder seems problematic, because they will systematically erase files that are not part of the project
in other words anything that gets uploaded will be deleted within about five days or so.
Uploading larger files to cloudinary involves a litle bit more programming, but most of all it costs extra. At least to my understanding.
